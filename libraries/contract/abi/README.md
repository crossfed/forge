# Contract ABI

Target `forge_contract_abi`, package component `contract_abi`, owns Clang AST
analysis, Spring/CDT-compatible ABI generation, Ricardian metadata and generated
dispatchers. Public modules are `forge.contract.abi.generator` and
`forge.contract.abi.command` in namespace `forge::contract::abi`.

```cpp
import forge.contract.abi.generator;

auto result = forge::contract::abi::generate({
   .contract = "token",
   .abi = "token.abi",
   .dispatcher = "token.dispatcher.cpp",
   .attribute_plugin = "attr-plugin",
   .sysroot = "wasm32-sysroot",
   .sources = {"token.cpp"},
});
```

The first request source is the dispatch source and must declare the selected
contract. The generator verifies this rule and includes its canonical path, so
quoted includes keep normal C++ lookup semantics. `forge_add_contract` selects
the only source automatically; multi-source contracts must name
`DISPATCH_SOURCE` explicitly. When `request::depfile` is set, the generator
writes compiler-derived dependencies for every source/header opened during
analysis; Contract SDK CMake combines them with direct Ricardian dependencies
to prevent stale incremental ABI output. Integer ABI names are selected from
the Clang target model; in wasm32, `long` is 32 bits. Following CDT
`EOSIO_DISPATCH`, generated local actions execute only when `code == receiver`;
notifications require an explicit notification dispatcher. The library contains
no CLI `main`, compiler patches or guest runtime. Its tests are the pinned CDT
pass/fail fixtures plus local-include and wasm32-width regressions.

`sdk_include_paths` and the matching `abigen --sdk-include` option are reserved
for roots shipped by the selected Contract SDK. They remain ordinary C++
include roots so SDK-owned compatibility aliases retain their ABI meaning, but
are separately trusted by dependency validation. Files reached through other
include paths must be declared by the contract graph even when they are outside
a descriptor's source root. This keeps SDK implementation headers out of
product attestation without treating them as compiler system headers.

For a multi-source build, `request::source_wrappers` contains one generated
output path for each source after the dispatch source. Each wrapper includes
its original translation unit and emits only the generated record codec
definitions visible there. `forge_add_contract` configures these paths
automatically and compiles the wrappers instead of compiling helper sources a
second time. This preserves separate compilation and source-local type
visibility while making generated codecs available in every contract source.

For generated dispatchers, `abigen` also emits memberwise `forge.raw` codecs
for user-defined ABI records, including records used by action parameters and
results. Namespace-scope record codecs are declared before the contract source,
so action implementations can use `forge::raw::pack` and `unpack` without a
separate serialization macro.
Fields are encoded in declaration order after the single public, non-virtual
base, matching the generated ABI. Unions, inaccessible fields, references,
const fields, bit-fields and multiple or virtual bases are rejected instead of
producing an ABI that the guest dispatcher cannot execute.
Legacy `EOSIO_DISPATCH` sources use the same generated codecs: their macro
dispatch is deferred until after the codec specializations are declared.
Hand-written `apply` functions remain fully author-owned and are included
without generated dispatch code.

Only actual standard-library templates receive CDT container encodings such as
`T[]`. A product type named `vector`, `map`, `optional` or another standard
container name remains a user ABI record. Generated dispatch supports both
const and non-const action member functions.

Modern `[[forge::action]]` and `[[forge::call]]` parameters must be named so
their ABI fields are usable by clients. The EOSIO spelling preserves CDT's
legacy unnamed-parameter output for source and ABI compatibility.

## Dependencies

- `forge_chain_protocol` and `forge_codec_json` for canonical ABI values;
- compatible `clang-cpp` and `LLVM` for target-aware AST analysis.

Requesting package component `contract_abi` is the only case where this API
causes Forge package discovery to require Clang.

## Stability And Tests

The request/artifact API is Experimental in Forge 8.16.0; the generated ABI and
dispatcher behavior are Stable compatibility contracts. Unit, CDT fixture,
quoted-include, wasm32 integer-width, action-result, package and relocation
tests cover the public surface.
