# Forge Auth HTTP

`forge_auth_http` owns product-neutral browser authentication evidence and
response policy. It adapts `forge_auth_session` records to strict Cookie,
Origin, CSRF and security-header mechanics, while `forge_net_http` remains the
sole Cookie and Set-Cookie parser/formatter owner.

Public modules:

- `forge.auth.http.exceptions`: typed evidence, Origin, CSRF, scope and policy
  failures.
- `forge.auth.http.types`: transient browser evidence and cookie/origin policy
  values.
- `forge.auth.http.policy`: extraction, authorization, cookie response helpers
  and browser security headers.

`extract_session_evidence` accepts explicitly supplied HTTP header values; it
does not own a router or transport facade. It requires one session cookie,
rejects duplicate Cookie, Origin and CSRF evidence, and requires CSRF evidence
for mutating methods. `authorize` validates a caller-loaded session and pairing
credential, exact Origin policy, a non-empty approved scope and double-submit
CSRF evidence. Safe `GET`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` requests may omit Origin;
mutating methods require it. Unknown methods and wildcard origins are rejected.
Origins are canonical serialized `http` or `https` origins: they have an
authority only, omit user info, path, query and fragment, and omit default
ports (`http:80`, `https:443`).

Cookie helpers always emit distinct `__Host-` names with `Secure`, `Path=/` and
`SameSite=Strict`; session cookies are `HttpOnly`, while CSRF and pre-session
cookies are frontend-readable. They use `append_set_cookie`, preserving one
`Set-Cookie` field per cookie. Security headers protect same-origin application
responses without applying `no-store` to assets unless the explicit sensitive
response option is selected.

This leaf has no persistence, routes, plugin, product-role, audit or rate-limit
dependency. Callers load records, choose allowed origins and integrate product
rate limiting/audit outside this library.

Dependencies: `forge_auth_session`, `forge_net_http` (private `Boost.URL`
parser backend).
